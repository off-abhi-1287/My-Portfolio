# 💻 Portfolio Website – Abhinay Borkar

A personal portfolio built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS** during DevTown’s bootcamp. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact form in a clean, dark theme.

## ⚙️ Tech Used
- HTML  
- Tailwind CSS  
- AOS Library (for scroll animations)

## 🧠 Experience & Challenges

While building this:
- I understood how to make responsive layouts using Tailwind.
- I learned how to organize sections properly.
- Faced difficulty adjusting form colors with dark themes.
- Struggled with deploying real project links — I’ve only added 1 working project now, more coming soon.
- Didn't add resume yet, will update in future.
